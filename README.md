# COMP2001_API

This repository contains the code for the COMP2001 Authenticator API coursework.  It is created in Visual Studio 2019 using the C# language and the Web API template.  

The API provides the implementation for the [attached yaml file](COMP2001_API.yaml) contract.  This means there is just one endpoint, User.  The endpoint responds to the GET, PUT, POST and DELETE HTTP verbs only and uses the JSON User object as outlined in the file.
